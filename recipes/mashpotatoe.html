    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Come here for a traditional Thanks Giving meal which will make everyone around the table delightful ! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cream/Milk</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
        <li>Potatoes (of course !)</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>More butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the Potatoes: Peel the potatoes (per the recipe below).</li>
        <li>Cut into quarters and place into cold salted water in a large pot (cold water helps to ensure they cook evenly).</li>
        <li>Boil the Potatoes: Cook potatoes in boiling water until tender. The length of time you need to boil the potatoes depends on how big they are cut. I cut my potatoes into quarters and boil them for about 15 minutes.  To check if your potatoes are ready, use a fork to poke the potato and see if it is tender!</li>
        <li>Mash the Potatoes:  Once well-drained, mash with the potatoes with a hand masher and with melted butter, warmed milk, and salt & pepper per the recipe below.</li>
        <li>Spread them into a greased casserole pan, dot with butter if desired and cover. Bake at 325°F until the butter melts and the potatoes are heated through, about 35-40 minutes. If you’d like a browned crust, bake uncovered.</li>
    </ol>
